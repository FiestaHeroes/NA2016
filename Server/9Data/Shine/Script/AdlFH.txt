#Record	GuardAlber01_01H	I was worried about Loussier and came back again. But it is too dangerous here now its seized by Eglack!	
#Record	Marlene01_01H	I cannot leave Loussier here alone. Loussier just came here to save village people. 	
#Record	GuardAlber01_02H	"I am so sorry but I give up. Do you think Loussier still alive? Ah, is that Loussier? Loussier is chased by soldiers. I have to save Loussier!"	
#Record	Salare01_S01H	"Sir Eglack, they appear again, to interruped our plan."	
#Record	Eglack01_S01H	That was what we expected. How about the plan? Is it going on well?	
#Record	Salare01_S02H	"Yes, everything is fine. This world will become yours soon."	
#Record	Eglack01_S02H	Good to here that. I will kill all of them this time.	
#Record	Marlene01_S01H	Loussier! I am so happy to meet you again. Where did you hide yourself?	
#Record	Loussier01_S01H	I was hiding around the Adelia Tree root to avoid monsters  and I saw something scary.	
#Record	GuardAlber01_S01H	Something scary?	
#Record	Loussier01_S02H	"Because of the Stone of Darkness, the world is turning into dark and Eglack's army got mad with poisoning. "	
#Record	Loussier01_S03H	I saw they were fighting each other. They all got so mad and fought cruelly to kill others.	
#Record	Loussier01_S04H	"As I saw the madness, I found out there must be some problem to the Adelia tree that once protected Adelia."	
#Record	Loussier01_S05H	"I tried hard to escape there to let you know about this, but Eglack's soldier caught me…..."	
#Record	GuardAlber01_S02H	"You mean you were chased by Eglack's army…… If this is true, it is a big problem.."	
#Record	Marlene01_S02H	Adelia and every place around Adelia will get full of madness. Before that happens you should stop them.	
#Record	Loussier01_S06H	"For that we have to destroy the Stone of Darkness to stop the poisoning, and stop Eglack and Salare."	
#Record	Marlene01_S03H	But what if you get mad while fighting with them?	
#Record	Loussier01_S07H	"I have an idea. As I see, the recovery spring hasn't been poisoned yet. "	
#Record	Loussier01_S08H	You can go to the recovery spring to recover if you get poisoned.	
#Record	Marlene01_S04H	Okay. Then let's hurry up before Eglack poisons Adelia!	
#Record	Salare01_F01H	Sir Eglack. I killed little the girl who disturbed us last time. 	
#Record	Eglack01_F01H	Good to hear that. Now only arrogant adventurers and Adelia are left. Hurry up!	
#Record	Salare03_01H	"Sir Eglack, they are defeating our army and coming here."	
#Record	Eglack03_01H	"Mad soldiers were defeated… The became stronger. By the way, how is it going on with the plan?"	
#Record	Salare03_02H	We need more time to complete the plan. I will go and kill them. 	
#Record	Eglack03_02H	Good. Then I will complete the plan. Kill everyone!!	
#Record	Salare03_S01H	I will let you go if you want… but only after you die!	
#Record	Loussier03_S01H	"Salare, I will make you come back as before past this time."	
#Record	Salare03_S02H	Are you still telling me silly jokes? I will kill you before that.	
#Record	Loussier03_S02H	"I will definitely do that for you, and for Adelia!"	
#Record	Salare03_F01H	I will let you go if you want… but only after you die!	
#Record	Salare03_F02H	"Huh, I can't believe you got me...  But Eglack will never be defeated.  It will be your grave.  Ha ha...'"	
#Record	Salare03_S03H	"Huh, I can't believe you got me...  But Eglack will never be defeated.  It will be your grave.  Ha ha...'"	
#Record	Loussier03_S03H	"Salare, I will purify Karen's magic in you...  Wait a moment. "	
#Record	Salare03_S04H	What... what are you doing?  Arrrgh~!  Arrrgh~	
#Record	Loussier03_S04H	Have you awakened?  I am Loussier. 	
#Record	SalareMan03_S01H	"Oh... I see,.. "	
#Record	Loussier03_S05H	You and Eglack were captured by Karen's magic while trying to protect Adealia. 	
#Record	Loussier03_S06H	I used my grandmother's necklace to purify you.	
#Record	SalareMan03_S02H	Oh......  I see...  I... I should have died then....	
#Record	SalareMan03_S03H	"Oh, thank you for bringing me back...."	
#Record	Loussier03_S07H	Salare...	
#Record	SalareMan03_S04H	"Loussier, was it?..  Please go after Eglack...  Please save him..."	
#Record	Loussier03_S08H	"OK, Salare.  I will save Eglack, too. "	
#Record	SalareMan03_S05H	OK.... Good...  You should go...  Don't be late.	
#Record	Loussier03_S09H	" .. .. We have to go.  You should rest here, Salare.  Marlene will be here soon. "	
#Record	Eglack04_01H	Isn't it possible to defeat them before Salare got stronger with the power of darkness?	
#Record	Eglack04_02H	"Too late. Once you arrive in Adelia, you will see hell. Hahahaha."	
#Record	Eglack05_S01H	Can you see? This Adelia lost its power and is becoming grey everywhere! Covered by darkness!	
#Record	Loussier05_S01H	Oh no! I cannot feel any power from the Adelia tree.	
#Record	Eglack05_S02H	Come here! I will kill you and bury with Adelia!	
#Record	EglackMan05_S01H	"Oh, where am I?  Why am I here...  Who are you?"	
#Record	Loussier05_S02H	"Eglack, are you OK?  I am Loussier and these people helped me. "	
#Record	Loussier05_S03H	You were enticed by Karen's magic and tried to destroy Adealia. 	
#Record	Loussier05_S04H	But the village was under protection...  He's destroyed now. 	
#Record	EglackMan05_S02H	"Oh!  I have destroyed the village... with my own hands...  Loussier, I have a request. "	
#Record	Loussier05_S05H	What?  Oh...  OK.  If it is anything I can do...	
#Record	EglackMan05_S03H	I can't return to the village like this.	
#Record	EglackMan05_S04H	Everyone will...  Even if it wasn't my real self...	
#Record	EglackMan05_S05H	I want to leave.  Can you keep the secret for me? 	
#Record	Loussier05_S06H	What?!  Oh.. well... OK.  If that's what you want...	
#Record	EglackMan05_S06H	"Thank you, Loussier. "	
#Record	EglackMan05_S07H	"Well, so long...."	
#Record	Loussier05_S07H	I won't forget what you've done for me...	
#Record	Eglack05_F01H	Can you see? This Adelia lost its power and is becoming grey everywhere! Covered by darkness!	
#Record	Eglack05_F02H	Come here! I will kill you and bury with Adelia!	
#Record	Eglack05_F03H	Wait! It is not over yet. Karen! Where is Karen?	
#Record	Karen05_F01H	"I am here, Eglack. Did you lose again? Ugh! You are so pathetic."	
#Record	Eglack05_F04AH	Quite! Power! Give me that strong power one more time!	
#Record	Karen05_F02H	Alright. But you should make me happy and don't disappointed like last time.	
#Record	Eglack05_F04BH	"If you give me strong power to wipe them, I will be glad to be your pet anytime!"	
#Record	Karen05_F03H	"I would love to. Alright, I will give you stronger powers than before. Make me happy this time Eglack. "	
#Record	Eglack05_F05H	Arrrrgh!!!	
#Record	EglackMad05_F01H	Hahahaha!! I can feel the power. Much stronger power! I cannot this compare with the last one!!	
#Record	EglackMad05_F02H	Never! I can never be gone like this! Again! Give me the power again! Ow!	
#Record	Karen05_F04H	"Everything is over. You were just nothing… Leave this place Eglack! Let's meet together again, all adventurers!!"	
#Record	Loussier_Dead	I can't believe it...  I can't hold on.  I am sorry....	
#Record	Marlene_Dead	This is it for me..  I am sorry I can't help you more...  Please take care of the rest...
