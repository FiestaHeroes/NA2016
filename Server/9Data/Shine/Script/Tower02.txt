#Record	ChatC31_5	I'm mortified!
#Record	ChatC31_6	How can I be caught in a place like this? It's so unfair!
#Record	ChatC31_7	It wasn't that strong.
#Record	ChatC31_8	"I captured the assassin, then shall I go to the village to get the reward? Great~"
		
#Record	ChatC32_1	"Finally, we almost came to the end."
#Record	ChatC32_2	They are affected by the Pillar of Light. Let’s deal with the Pillar of Light first.

#Record	ChatC32_16	"So, what do you say after you opened my treasure box?"
#Record	ChatC32_17	"And if given a chance, try to fight with my magic monster, Jewel Golem!"
#Record	ChatC32_18	It’s not as easy as the Lizard Man though!
#Record	ChatC32_19	"Farewell, adventurers! I hope to see you guys again!"
		
#Record	ChatC33_1	The Great Orc? That's as easy as pie!

#Record	ChatC33_14	"The Great Orc is just a bit stronger than the guardian Lizard Man, but I was amazed that you defeated it this easily."
#Record	ChatC33_15	"Anyway, since you came here, open the treasure box."
#Record	ChatC33_16	You got the item.
#Record	ChatC33_17	"So, what do you say after you opened my treasure box?"
#Record	ChatC33_18	I hope you could find something useful in the treasure box.
#Record	ChatC33_19	"And if given a chance, try to fight with my magic monster, Jewel Golem!"
#Record	ChatC33_20	It’s not as easy as the Great Orc though!
#Record	ChatC33_21	"Farewell, adventurers! I hope to see you guys again!"
		
#Record	ChatC34_1	"Finally, this is our last moment!"

#Record	ChatC34_15	How great! You defeated all the monsters that I made of my magic.
#Record	ChatC34_16	But keep this in your mind that this is not the end.
#Record	ChatC34_17	"There will be more powerful monsters in the next tower, so think of this as a practice."
#Record	ChatC34_18	"Anyway, congratulations! Please open my Crystal box."
#Record	ChatC34_19	Ther will be something useful to you.
