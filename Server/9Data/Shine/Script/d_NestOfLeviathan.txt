#Record	Start0	Soldiers, be careful!
#Record	Start1	I know you want to see how Leviathan looks like, but don't push it.  This is a dangerous place...	
#Record	Start2	Gather some valuable artifacts and come back safe.  Although it won't be easy.....	
			
#Record	KingBoogy0	We captured King Boogy!	
#Record	KingBoogy1	Well dong, soldiers!	
#Record	KingBoogy2	Now that we have found good artifacts, how about going back now?	
#Record	KingBoogy3	Going back safe would be more important than finding valuables…	
#Record	KingBoogy4	I can't stop you from risking your lives to go in farther, but be careful!						
								
#Record	KingCrap0	Wow, you defeated King Crab.  Nice job. 						
#Record	KingCrap1	You have already found a lot of valuables.  Let's go back.  It is too dangerous to proceed!						
#Record	KingCrap2	What?  You want to go in farther?  You are stubborn.  Let me tell you one more thing!		
#Record	KingCrap3	Some of the parties have gone farther in, but none of them have returned alive.  Got it?						
#Record	KingCrap4	If you won't blame me after your deaths... Be my guest!  That is all that I can tell you!						
								
#Record	Leviathan0	Unbelievable!						
#Record	Leviathan1	I can't believe it!  Did you really defeat that Vicious Leviathan? 			
#Record	Leviathan2	So, what did that evil monster have?  It must be a priceless artifact.  Let me have a look. 						
#Record	Leviathan3	Magnificent!  You are truly blessed!					
#Record	Leviathan4	I didn't think I would see the day... Congratulations.  I hope you have wonderful lives!
